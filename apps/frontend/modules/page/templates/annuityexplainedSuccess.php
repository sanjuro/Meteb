  <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">  <p><strong>What is a with-profit annuity</strong></p>
                <p>                  Your investment in Momentum&#8217;s with-profit  annuity guarantees to pay you an income for the rest of your life, no matter  how long you live. With-profit annuities also give you the opportunity of  sharing in the future profits made by the fund and so your annuity income will  potentially rise in future years. <br />
                  The aim of our with-profit  annuity is to provide as much income growth over time as possible by way of  annual increases. Profits arise mainly from steady investment performance, but  could also come from mortality experience.</p></div>

  <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent"><p><strong>The advantages of with-profit annuities</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They pay a guaranteed income  for life which will never decrease.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Once an increase is awarded, it  can never be taken away and the new higher income is guaranteed for life.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They enable retired investors to  maintain some exposure to fixed interest, property and equities.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They provide the potential of a  growing income with security and peace of mind.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They smooth investment returns,  ironing out investment peaks and troughs.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>In the longer term, with-profit  annuities should provide protection against inflation.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Retired investors can opt for  their spouse to receive a pension when they pass away.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>With-profit annuities can also  be guaranteed to be paid for a certain period of time. This means that if you  pass away soon after investing, your nominated beneficiaries or estate will  continue to receive income payments.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>

  <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0"><span class="AccordionPanelTab">Your Pension Increases</span></div>
  <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">                <p>Your annual increase depends on  the performance of the with-profit annuity investments together with our  smoothing techniques and your chosen PRI*. <br />
                  <em>NOTE: Post Retirement  Interest Rate (PRI) is a choice you make and is described under your Annuity  Options.</em><br />
                  <strong>Smoothing your increases</strong><br />
                  Your pension increases are not  constant and can be higher or lower from year to year. At Momentum we  understand the importance of stability when it comes to annuity investments and  are therefore able to protect you from ups and downs in the market. This  technique is called &ldquo;smoothing&rdquo;.<br />
                  Smoothing simply means that  strong or poor returns in any single year will be spread out over a few years.  This ensures that your increases absorb uncertainty and remain stable.<br />
                  The graph below shows how  smoothing protects you against the ups and downs in a volatile market.</p>

                <p><strong>Our investment policy</strong><br />
Your pension assets are invested  in a balanced fund with two aims in mind:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Generate as much profit as possible to provide you with as high an  increase as possible.</li>
                  <li>Meet our guarantee to pay your income for as long as you live.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We also ensure that you get exposure  to a wide variety of asset classes, in South Africa as well as abroad. Your  annual increases are linked directly to the ongoing performance of the  with-profit annuity balanced fund. </p>
                <p>The  chart below shows the strategic asset allocation we utilise for the with-profit  annuity assets </p>
                <p><img src="toolbox/piechart1.jpg" width="550" height="280" alt="pieChart" /></p>
                <p><strong>Historical increases</strong><br />
                  Over the past ten years very  competitive pension increases have been awarded, helping to reduce the impact  of inflation. Please refer to the product downloads section <u>here</u> for  our historical increases. <br />
                Although our with-profit  annuities do not guarantee that pension increases will meet inflation every  year; Momentum still aims to reduce the impact of inflation over the longer  term.</p>

  <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent"><strong>Annuity </strong>An agreement between an insurer and a policyholder  whereby the insurer makes regular payments to the policyholder throughout the  life of the consumer.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Balanced Fund </strong>A fund that has investments diversified over  equities, bonds, property and money market instruments.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Bonus rate </strong>The net rate of return declared on the with-profit  annuity assets from which annual increases are determined.<br />

    <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI) </strong>An indicator used to  monitor inflation, also referred to as the cost-of-living index. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Guarantee period </strong>The minimum period that  you want your annuity to be paid out for certain. Should you pass away within  the guarantee period, your annuity will continue to be paid to your nominated  beneficiaries or estate.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Inflation </strong>A rise in the general price level of goods and  services, which leads to decreasing purchasing power of the currency concerned. <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <strong>Mortality profits </strong>A profit or loss incurred  by the insurer as a result of differences in the actual length of policyholder  lifetimes and the assumed length of such lifetimes. To provide an annuity for  the life of policyholders, the insurer needs to make an assumption about the expected  length of policyholder lifetimes. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Post-retirement interest  (PRI) rate</strong> A rate that represents  the minimum amount of investment profit or returns the portfolio underlying the  with-profit annuity has to achieve to continue paying the current level of  pension per year. <br />

    <br />
    <strong>Socially responsible investment (SRI)</strong> One of the asset classes  in our with-profit annuity assets. In order for an investment to be classified  as an SRI it must meet a number of criteria, such as a business's commitment to  black economic empowerment, addressing HIV/Aids in the workplace, labour  policies and environmental practices. <br />
    <strong></strong><br />
  <strong>With-Profit Annuity </strong>An annuity contract that allows policyholders to  share in the profits made on the with-profit assets. This profit-sharing is done  by way of future annual increases.</div>
