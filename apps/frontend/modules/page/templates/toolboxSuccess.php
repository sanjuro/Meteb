                <p><strong>What is a with-profit annuity</strong></p>
                <p>                  Your investment in Momentum’s with-profit  annuity guarantees to pay you an income for the rest of your life, no matter  how long you live. With-profit annuities also give you the opportunity of  sharing in the future profits made by the fund and so your annuity income will  potentially rise in future years. <br />
                  The aim of our with-profit  annuity is to provide as much income growth over time as possible by way of  annual increases. Profits arise mainly from steady investment performance, but  could also come from mortality experience.</p>

                <p><strong>The advantages of with-profit annuities</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They pay a guaranteed income  for life which will never decrease.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Once an increase is awarded, it  can never be taken away and the new higher income is guaranteed for life.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They enable retired investors to  maintain some exposure to fixed interest, property and equities.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They provide the potential of a  growing income with security and peace of mind.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>They smooth investment returns,  ironing out investment peaks and troughs.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>In the longer term, with-profit  annuities should provide protection against inflation.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Retired investors can opt for  their spouse to receive a pension when they pass away.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>With-profit annuities can also  be guaranteed to be paid for a certain period of time. This means that if you  pass away soon after investing, your nominated beneficiaries or estate will  continue to receive income payments.<strong></strong></li>

                <p>Your annual increase depends on  the performance of the with-profit annuity investments together with our  smoothing techniques and your chosen PRI*. <br />
                  <em>NOTE: Post Retirement  Interest Rate (PRI) is a choice you make and is described under your Annuity  Options.</em><br />
                  <strong>Smoothing your increases</strong><br />
                  Your pension increases are not  constant and can be higher or lower from year to year. At Momentum we  understand the importance of stability when it comes to annuity investments and  are therefore able to protect you from ups and downs in the market. This  technique is called &ldquo;smoothing&rdquo;.<br />
                  Smoothing simply means that  strong or poor returns in any single year will be spread out over a few years.  This ensures that your increases absorb uncertainty and remain stable.<br />
                  The graph below shows how  smoothing protects you against the ups and downs in a volatile market.</p>
                <p><img src="toolbox/graph-returns.jpg" width="640" height="251" alt="graph" /></p>
                <p><strong>Our investment policy</strong><br />
Your pension assets are invested  in a balanced fund with two aims in mind:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Generate as much profit as possible to provide you with as high an  increase as possible.</li>
                  <li>Meet our guarantee to pay your income for as long as you live.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We also ensure that you get exposure  to a wide variety of asset classes, in South Africa as well as abroad. Your  annual increases are linked directly to the ongoing performance of the  with-profit annuity balanced fund. </p>
                <p>The  chart below shows the strategic asset allocation we utilise for the with-profit  annuity assets </p>

                <p><strong>Historical increases</strong><br />
                  Over the past ten years very  competitive pension increases have been awarded, helping to reduce the impact  of inflation. Please refer to the product downloads section <u>here</u> for  our historical increases. <br />
                Although our with-profit  annuities do not guarantee that pension increases will meet inflation every  year; Momentum still aims to reduce the impact of inflation over the longer  term.</p>

              <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
              <p><strong>Annuity </strong>An agreement between an insurer and a policyholder  whereby the insurer makes regular payments to the policyholder throughout the  life of the consumer.<br />
                  <strong>Balanced Fund </strong>A fund that has investments diversified over  equities, bonds, property and money market instruments.<br />
                  <strong>Bonus rate </strong>The net rate of return declared on the with-profit  annuity assets from which annual increases are determined.<br />
                  <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI) </strong>An indicator used to  monitor inflation, also referred to as the cost-of-living index. <br />
                  <strong>Guarantee period </strong>The minimum period that  you want your annuity to be paid out for certain. Should you pass away within  the guarantee period, your annuity will continue to be paid to your nominated  beneficiaries or estate.<br />
                  <strong>Inflation </strong>A rise in the general price level of goods and  services, which leads to decreasing purchasing power of the currency concerned. <br />
                  <strong>Insurer / insurance company </strong>A company that agrees to pay the consumer an amount  or amounts on the occurrence of an event that is defined in the contract with  the policyholder.<br />
                  <strong>Investment profits / investment return </strong>The money that has been made from an investment in  assets. This can include growth in the value of an asset or dividends paid to  the investor.<br />
                  <strong>Joint life annuity </strong>An annuity that is  payable to the annuitant and his/her spouse until both individuals have passed  away. (Compare with Single life annuity)<br />
                  <strong>Mortality experience </strong>See Mortality profits<br />
                  <strong>Mortality profits </strong>A profit or loss incurred  by the insurer as a result of differences in the actual length of policyholder  lifetimes and the assumed length of such lifetimes. To provide an annuity for  the life of policyholders, the insurer needs to make an assumption about the expected  length of policyholder lifetimes. <br />
                  <strong>Post-retirement interest  (PRI) rate</strong> A rate that represents  the minimum amount of investment profit or returns the portfolio underlying the  with-profit annuity has to achieve to continue paying the current level of  pension per year. <br />
                  <strong>Purchasing Power </strong>The amount of goods or  services that one unit of money can buy for the currency concerned. In general,  inflation decreases the amount of goods or services you would be able to  purchase.<br />
                  <strong>Single life annuity </strong>An annuity that is  payable only to the main member and the payments stop upon his/her death. <br />
                  <strong>Smoothing </strong>A technique Momentum  applies to investment profits in order to provide stable increases from one  year to the next. <br />
                  <strong>Socially responsible investment (SRI)</strong> One of the asset classes  in our with-profit annuity assets. In order for an investment to be classified  as an SRI it must meet a number of criteria, such as a business's commitment to  black economic empowerment, addressing HIV/Aids in the workplace, labour  policies and environmental practices. <strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>With-Profit Annuity </strong>An annuity contract that allows policyholders to  share in the profits made on the with-profit assets. This profit-sharing is done  by way of future annual increases. </p>

          <p>At Momentum we understand the importance and value in allowing you to tailor your annuity income to meet your personal circumstances. There are potentially 3 important options you need to decide on when investing in our with-profit annuity.

          <div id="Accordion2" class="Accordion" tabindex="0">
            <div class="AccordionPanel">
              <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Post Retirement Interest Rate (PRI)</div>
              <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
                <p>The PRI rate you choose will  determine your starting annuity income and it will affect your future annual  increases. The PRI can be seen as the upfront rate of future returns you want  your starting annuity to take credit for. This is because only investment  returns in excess of your PRI are available for your pension increases.<br />
                  The higher the chosen PRI:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The higher the starting level  of income will be</li>
                  <li>But the lower future increase  will be.</li>
                </ul>
<p>The chart below shows how your  annuity income may grow over time for two different PRI categories. Please note  your actual future increases may differ to the chart below and that past  performance is no guarantee of future results. Your own starting pension will  depend on your particulars such as the amount available for investment; the  options you choose; your age and sex. </p>
<p><img src="toolbox/annuitycomparison.jpg" width="650" height="327" alt="annuity comparison" /></p>
                <p>Your annual increase comes from  the investment profits that remain after your PRI has been met.  <br />
Consider for example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pensioner on 4% PRI</li>
                  <li>Investment returns of 10%</li>
                  <li>Then 4% of these returns will  be used to maintain your current level of income</li>
                  <li>The remaining 6% (10% - 4%)  will be used to increase your pension.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It  is only natural to want the highest PRI which gives the highest initial income,  but you shouldn’t forget the effects of lower future increases which could  erode your purchasing power. A with-profit annuity with a lower PRI will start  lower, but it will potentially award higher increases in the future.</p>

              <div class="AccordionPanelTab"> Single or Joint Life </div>
              <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
                <p>A single life annuity pays a  higher level of income than a joint life annuity, but stops when you pass away  (if no guarantee period was chosen).<br />
                  If you choose a joint life  annuity the pension payments will continue to your spouse or common-law partner  if you pass away first. You can choose how much income your spouse will receive  after you have died by selecting a spouse’s reversion %. <br />
                  For example, a 75% spouse’s  reversion means that when you pass away, your spouse will receive 75% of your  pension for as long as they live.</p>

            <div class="AccordionPanel">
              <div class="AccordionPanelTab">2.3	Guarantee Period</div>
              <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
                <p>A guarantee period allows you to  guarantee your annuity to be paid for a certain period of time. This means that  if you pass away soon after investing, your nominated beneficiaries or estate  will continue to receive income payments.<br />
                  You can choose 5 or 10 year  guaranteed periods or no guarantee at all. If you select a 5 year guarantee  period and passed away after 3 years, your income will continue to be paid to  your dependants for another 2 years. If you select a 10 year guarantee, the  income payments would continue for another 7 years.</p>
                <p>If  you invested in our with-profit annuity without a guarantee period and died the  day after, your income payments will stop and your family would get nothing  (unless a joint life annuity was selected). It is important to note that in  this scenario your investment will be shared as mortality profits and will be  distributed to the other with-profit pensioners by way of enhanced increases.  By choosing a guaranteed period you can protect yourself and your family  against this rare event.</p>

                <h2>Glossary</h2>
                <p><strong>Annuity </strong>An agreement between an insurer and a policyholder  whereby the insurer makes regular payments to the policyholder throughout the  life of the consumer.<br />
                  <strong>Balanced Fund </strong>A fund that has investments diversified over  equities, bonds, property and money market instruments.<br />
                  <strong>Bonus rate </strong>The net rate of return declared on the with-profit  annuity assets from which annual increases are determined.<br />
                  <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI) </strong>An indicator used to  monitor inflation, also referred to as the cost-of-living index. <br />
                  <strong>Guarantee period </strong>The minimum period that  you want your annuity to be paid out for certain. Should you pass away within  the guarantee period, your annuity will continue to be paid to your nominated  beneficiaries or estate.<br />
                  <strong>Inflation </strong>A rise in the general price level of goods and  services, which leads to decreasing purchasing power of the currency concerned. <br />
                  <strong>Insurer / insurance company </strong>A company that agrees to pay the consumer an amount  or amounts on the occurrence of an event that is defined in the contract with  the policyholder.<br />
                  <strong>Investment profits / investment return </strong>The money that has been made from an investment in  assets. This can include growth in the value of an asset or dividends paid to  the investor.<br />
                  <strong>Joint life annuity </strong>An annuity that is  payable to the annuitant and his/her spouse until both individuals have passed  away. (Compare with Single life annuity)<br />
                  <strong>Mortality experience </strong>See Mortality profits<br />
                  <strong>Mortality profits </strong>A profit or loss incurred  by the insurer as a result of differences in the actual length of policyholder  lifetimes and the assumed length of such lifetimes. To provide an annuity for  the life of policyholders, the insurer needs to make an assumption about the expected  length of policyholder lifetimes. <br />
                  <strong>Post-retirement interest  (PRI) rate</strong> A rate that represents  the minimum amount of investment profit or returns the portfolio underlying the  with-profit annuity has to achieve to continue paying the current level of  pension per year. <br />
                  <strong>Purchasing Power </strong>The amount of goods or  services that one unit of money can buy for the currency concerned. In general,  inflation decreases the amount of goods or services you would be able to  purchase.<br />
                  <strong>Single life annuity </strong>An annuity that is  payable only to the main member and the payments stop upon his/her death. <br />
                  <strong>Smoothing </strong>A technique Momentum  applies to investment profits in order to provide stable increases from one  year to the next. <br />
                  <strong>Socially responsible investment (SRI)</strong> One of the asset classes  in our with-profit annuity assets. In order for an investment to be classified  as an SRI it must meet a number of criteria, such as a business's commitment to  black economic empowerment, addressing HIV/Aids in the workplace, labour  policies and environmental practices. <strong></strong><br />
                  <strong>With-Profit Annuity </strong>An annuity contract that allows policyholders to  share in the profits made on the with-profit assets. This profit-sharing is done  by way of future annual increases. </p>
